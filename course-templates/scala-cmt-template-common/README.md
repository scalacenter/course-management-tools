# Basic Scala CMT master master project

## Description

This project can be used as a template for a master
project managed by the [Course Management Tools](https://github.com/eloots/course-management-tools)

It contains 2 simple steps (or exercises)

This template has a `common` project which is aggregated in all exercises.
In general, using such a `common` project is discouraged, but it has use-cases
from which it is perfectly valid (for example, in demonstration where there's
a big chunk of code that is repeated in all exercises and that would draw
the attention away from the _"action"_ in each exercise).
